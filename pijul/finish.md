We have now discussed the basics of patch based version control provided by pijul.

The hallmark seen here is by far the additional ease of use that managing changes brings over traditional systems.

It is easy to see the benefits for collaborative work where changes that might conflict can still be applied partially and do not incur any history breakage.

Clearly you have also noticed that pijul's ergonomics still have potential for improvement as pijul itself is still approaching its first stable release.

Yet, given its goals and ambitions and the fact that sits developers have found a solution that plagued previous patch based VCS are very promising.

Keep an eye on [Pijul](https://pijul.org/), as it might be the next generation VCS tools.
